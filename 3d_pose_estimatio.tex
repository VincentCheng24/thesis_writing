\subsection{3D Pose Estimation of Vehicles}

for the beginning

Recently, great progress has been made on 2D image understanding
tasks, such as object detection [13] and instance
segmentation [14]. However, beyond getting 2D bounding
boxes or pixel masks, 3D understanding is eagerly in demand
in many applications such as autonomous driving and
augmented reality (AR).


Pose recovery is an important issue for many computer vision applications, including video indexing, surveillance, automotive safety and behaviour analysis, as well as many other Human Computer Interaction applications.
