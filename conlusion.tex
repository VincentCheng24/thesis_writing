 \subsection{Conclusion}
 This thesis deals with the problem of 3D pose estimation of vehicles based on monocular images by using deep neural networks for the application of autonomous driving. Our approach can simultaneously performs 3D vehicle detection, 3D localization, 3D orientation estimation, 3D dimension estimation, 2D part localization, and parts visibility characterization for a vehicle in a 2D bounding box patch. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on six tasks. \tbd
